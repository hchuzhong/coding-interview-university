There is no genius.

If you are one in a million, that means there’s over a thousand people just like you.

You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else.

Even though it’s fun to write code alone, actually, coding it’s an inherently collaborative activity.

**Avoiding the Trap**

1. Drop the Ego
2. Criticism is Not Evil
3. Embrace Failure
4. Iterate Quickly
5. Practice is Key
6. Be a Small Fish(Work with smarter guys, then you can keep growing)
7. Be influence
8. Be Vulnerable

Obligatory Summary

1. Don’t try to be a genius
2. Collaborate early and often
3. Pay attention to your tools
4. Pay attention to timing

If you do all these things, people will **think** you are a genius.
