**Impostor Syndrome**

**Impostor syndrome**, also known as **impostor phenomenon** or **impostorism**, is a psychological occurrence. Those who have it may doubt their skills, talents, or accomplishments. They may have a persistent [internalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalizing_disorder) fear of being exposed as frauds.

Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this phenomenon do not believe they deserve their success or luck. They may think that they are deceiving others because they feel as if they are not as intelligent as they outwardly portray themselves to be.

冒名顶替综合症，也称为冒名顶替现象或冒名顶替，是一种心理现象。拥有它的人可能会怀疑他们的技能、才能或成就。他们可能有一种持续的内在恐惧，害怕被揭露为欺诈行为。 尽管有外部证据表明他们有能力，但那些经历过这种现象的人并不认为他们应该得到成功或运气。他们可能认为自己在欺骗别人，因为他们觉得自己并不像外表描绘的那样聪明。

**Dunning-Kruger Effect**

The **Dunning–Kruger effect** is a [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) in which people with limited competence in a particular domain overestimate their abilities. It was first described by [Justin Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Kruger) and [David Dunning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dunning) in 1999. Some researchers also include the opposite effect for high performers: their tendency to underestimate their skills. In popular culture, the Dunning–Kruger effect is often misunderstood as a claim about general overconfidence of people with low intelligence instead of specific overconfidence of people unskilled at a particular task.

邓宁-克鲁格效应是一种认知偏差，即在特定领域能力有限的人高估了自己的能力。它由贾斯汀·克鲁格（Justin Kruger）和大卫·邓宁（David Dunning）于1999年首次描述。一些研究人员还对高绩效者产生了相反的影响：他们倾向于低估自己的技能。在流行文化中，邓宁-克鲁格效应经常被误解为对低智商的人普遍过度自信的说法，而不是对不擅长特定任务的人的特定过度自信。
